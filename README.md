Many of us want to explore space but it might be difficult for all of us to do so. So, we have come up with an idea to make an interactive Application that tries to solve the above problem.

Sending a Rocket from ground to space is an art of technology which started in the year 1950. There are several criterias that need to be considered for a successful launch of the rocket. Itâ€™s difficult for common users to know the art without much theoretical and practical knowledge. So, In this Application we tried to show how the fundamental physical phenomena such as gravitation, inertial frames, quantum vacuum etc, the type of engines are used and other factors that affect the trajectory of the rockets.
The list of rockets ranges from the most successful ones to the ones that are being developed to make exploration of the planets and other celestial bodies possible. 
The Application is designed in such a way that it would allow users to customize their own rocket by assembling the payload system, engines and other parts to find whether their rocket would reach their defined destination or not. Also for the users who are curious to know about how these technologies work, a section is provided where the users can try understanding the technologies better.
